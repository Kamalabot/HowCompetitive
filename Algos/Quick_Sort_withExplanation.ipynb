    "Quick Sort is a widely used sorting algorithm in computer science, but it's typically implemented as part of the standard library or as a low-level sorting routine rather than exposed as a standalone library or database feature. Python itself uses Quick Sort (or variants like Timsort, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm that incorporates elements of Quick Sort) for its built-in sorting functions. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Standard Library:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in sorted() function and the .sort() method for lists use an algorithm that combines elements of Quick Sort with other sorting techniques to optimize performance. In recent Python versions, this algorithm is known as Timsort, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm.\n",
    "NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy, a popular library for numerical and scientific computing in Python, provides its own sorting functions, such as numpy.sort() and numpy.argsort(). These functions often use Quick Sort as part of their sorting process.\n",
    "pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas, a data manipulation and analysis library, uses sorting extensively when working with DataFrames and Series. While the specific sorting algorithm may vary based on the data and context, Quick Sort is one of the algorithms that pandas can employ.\n",
    "Cython:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython, a superset of Python that allows for the creation of C extensions, can use Quick Sort as part of its sorting operations when working with arrays and data structures.\n",
    "C/C++ Standard Library:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's C API allows Python code to call functions from the C and C++ standard libraries. These libraries often use Quick Sort or other efficient sorting algorithms internally.\n",
    "Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite offer sorting capabilities for query results. While these databases may not explicitly expose Quick Sort as a feature, they use efficient sorting algorithms under the hood to optimize query performance. The choice of sorting algorithm may depend on the database engine and configuration.\n",
    "While Quick Sort is a foundational algorithm, its implementation details are often abstracted away from higher-level libraries and databases. Instead, these libraries and databases focus on providing high-level sorting interfaces and optimizing the overall performance of their sorting operations."
