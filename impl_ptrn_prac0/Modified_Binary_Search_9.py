# Pattern: Modified Binary Search
# Introduction: 
# Adapts binary search to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding elements in rotated sorted arrays.
# Use this pattern for problems involving sorted or rotated arrays where you need to find a specific element.

# Sample Problem: 
# Find an element in a rotated sorted array.

# Example:
nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
target = 0
# Output: 4

# LeetCode Problems:
# 1. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode #33)
# 2. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode #153)
# 3. Search a 2D Matrix II (LeetCode #240)
