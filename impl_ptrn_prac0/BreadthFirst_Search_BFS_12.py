# Pattern: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
# Introduction: 
# A traversal technique that explores nodes level by level in a tree or graph.

# Sample Problem:
# Perform level-order traversal of a binary tree.

# Example:
root = [3, 9, 20, None, None, 15, 7]
# Output: [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]

# LeetCode Problems:
# 1. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (LeetCode #102)
# 2. Rotting Oranges (LeetCode #994)
# 3. Word Ladder (LeetCode #127)
