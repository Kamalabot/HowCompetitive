# Pattern: Matrix Traversal
# Introduction: 
# Involves traversing elements in a matrix using different techniques (DFS, BFS, etc.).

# Sample Problem:
# Perform flood fill on a 2D grid. Change all the cells connected to the starting cell to a new color.

# Example:
image = [[1,1,1], [1,1,0], [1,0,1]]
sr, sc = 1, 1
newColor = 2
# Output: [[2,2,2], [2,2,0], [2,0,1]]

# LeetCode Problems:
# 1. Flood Fill (LeetCode #733)
# 2. Number of Islands (LeetCode #200)
# 3. Surrounded Regions (LeetCode #130)
