# Pattern: Dynamic Programming Patterns
# Introduction: 
# Involves breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and solving them using a bottom-up or top-down approach.

# Sample Problem:
# Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

# Example:
n = 5
# Output: 5 (The first five Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)

# LeetCode Problems:
# 1. Climbing Stairs (LeetCode #70)
# 2. House Robber (LeetCode #198)
# 3. Coin Change (LeetCode #322)
# 4. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) (LeetCode #1143)
# 5. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) (LeetCode #322)
# 6. Partition Equal Subset Sum (LeetCode #416)
