# Pattern: Binary Tree Traversal
# Introduction: 
# Involves visiting all the nodes in a binary tree in a specific order (PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder).

# Sample Problem:
# Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree.

# Example:
root = [1, None, 2, 3]
# Output: [1, 3, 2]

# LeetCode Problems:
# 1. PreOrder → Binary Tree Paths (LeetCode #257)
# 2. InOrder → Kth Smallest Element in a BST (LeetCode #230)
# 3. PostOrder → Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (LeetCode #124)
