# Pattern: Dynamic Programming Patterns
# Introduction:
# Involves breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and solving them using a bottom-up or top-down approach.

# Sample Problems of DP based pattern is provided in individual files:
# Fibonacci Numbers
#
# 0/1 Knapsack
#
# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
#
# Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
#
# Subset Sum
#
# Matrix Chain Multiplication


# Example:
n = 5
# Output: 5 (The first five Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)

# LeetCode Problems:
# 1. Climbing Stairs (LeetCode #70)
# 2. House Robber (LeetCode #198)
# 3. Coin Change (LeetCode #322)
# 4. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) (LeetCode #1143)
# 5. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) (LeetCode #322)
# 6. Partition Equal Subset Sum (LeetCode #416)
