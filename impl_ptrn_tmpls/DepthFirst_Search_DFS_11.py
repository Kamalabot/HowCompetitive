# Pattern: Depth-First Search (DFS)
# Introduction: 
# A traversal technique that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

# Sample Problem:
# Find all paths from the root to leaves in a binary tree.

# Example:
root = [1, 2, 3, None, 5]
# Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

# LeetCode Problems:
# 1. Clone Graph (LeetCode #133)
# 2. Path Sum II (LeetCode #113)
# 3. Course Schedule II (LeetCode #210)
