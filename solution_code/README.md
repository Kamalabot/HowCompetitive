Contains the programs that were taken from the book Learn to Code by Solving Problems. 

I believe that any task can be mastered and problem solving through coding too is one such task. The programs in this repo helped me to 
understand the process of problem solving. The problems were taken from many programming judges websites. The filenames are the problem
numbers provided in the programming judges website.

I benefited enormously from the activity of learning to problem solve by coding. I would like to share the progress and the solution I 
came across to those seeking to learn.
