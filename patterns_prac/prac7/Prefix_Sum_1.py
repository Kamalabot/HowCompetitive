# Pattern: Prefix Sum
# Introduction: Prefix Sum involves preprocessing an array to create a new array where each element at index i
# represents the sum of the array from the start up to i. This allows for efficient sum queries on subarrays.

# Sample Problem: Given an array nums, answer multiple queries about the sum of elements within a specific range [i, j].
# Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], i = 1, j = 3
# Output: 9

# intution 1: creating a new "sums" array that holds incrementing sums
# intution 2: sum of nums between indices is diff of those indices in sums array

# Example Implementation:
def prefix_sum(nums, i, j):
    pass


nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
i = 1
j = 3

print(prefix_sum(nums, i, j))

# LeetCode Problems:
# - Range Sum Query - Immutable (LeetCode #303)
# - Contiguous Array (LeetCode #525)
# - Subarray Sum Equals K (LeetCode #560)
